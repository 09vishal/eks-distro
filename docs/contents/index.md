# Amazon EKS Distro

Amazon **EKS Distro** (EKS-D) is a Kubernetes distribution based on and used by 
Amazon EKS to create reliable and secure Kubernetes clusters. With EKS-D,
you can rely on the same versions of Kubernetes and its dependencies deployed
by Amazon EKS. This includes the latest upstream updates as well as extended 
security patching support. EKS-D follows the same Kubernetes version release 
cycle as Amazon EKS and we provide the bits here.


Check out EKS Distro's [architecture](users/architecture) and give it a spin by using
one of the many exemplary [install](users/install) recipes or using
[build](users/build) instructions to build a cluster from scratch.
